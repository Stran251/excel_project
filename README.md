My initial task with this dataset is to uncover and delete any hidden duplicates, setting the stage for a cleaner and more insightful analysis.

After using the "Remove Duplicate" function within the data tools suite, I successfully identified and eliminated 26 rows of redundant data.

After eliminating duplicate entries, I observed that the distribution of ages within the dataset exhibited considerable variability, posing challenges to its analytical coherence. A viable solution to enhance the data's interpretability is to categorize the ages into distinct brackets. To achieve this, I employed a nested IF statement, classifying individuals under the age of 31 as belonging to the "adolescent" category, those aged 31 and above as "middle-aged," and individuals surpassing the age of 55 as "seniors."
